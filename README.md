The Filecrypt Application
=========================

This repo contains the PHP logic (well, the whole solution) for the website https://www.filecrypt.ws

As it stands, we aim to hit the following goals:

Outlined Features
-----------------
-   Simple upload form (duh)
-   Optional symmetric encryption, key generated via Javascript
-   Link / Download expiry
-   Secure removal of expired files
-   Emergency deletion link


Future Planned Features
-----------------------
-   Java applet for client-side encryption
-   Email warning / notification system
